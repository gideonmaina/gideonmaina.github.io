This post might seem trivial but this issue was the cause of a debate with another engineer. To avoid confusion and for posterity, this serves as a reference. Getting on with it...

The AT command `HTTPACTION` makes an actual HTTP REQUEST and triggers an event in the target's URL server.


`AT+HTTPREAD`  returns the response contents of the most recent HTTP request. The response content will persist until it is overwritten by the response content of another HTTP request.
